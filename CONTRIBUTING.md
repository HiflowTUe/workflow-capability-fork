# Getting started

1. Create your own branch in the code
2. Do the changes in your branch
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request describing the requested change.

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email juan.vander.heijden@philips.com instead.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Java are you using (java --version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
